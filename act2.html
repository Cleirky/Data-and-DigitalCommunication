                <h2>Data and Digital Communication</h2><br>
                 <p><b>Five Elements of Data Communication Systems</b><br><br>
                 <i>Message</i><br>
                 ▪ Is the information or data that is communicated. 
                 It may consist of text, numbers, images, sound, video,etc.
                <br><br><hr><br>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    <i>Sender</i><br>
                    ▪ The computer or device that sends the data or messages. In data communication system, computer is
                    usually used as a transmitter; it is also called a sender. A sender may be a computer, workstation, telephone,
                    video camera, etc.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    <i>Receiver</i><br>
                    ▪ The device that receives the data or messages. Receiver is also known as sink. The receiver can be a
                    computer, workstation, printer or a fax machine.
                 </p>
                 <br><br><hr><br>
                 <p>
                    <i>Medium</i><br>
                    ▪ The path through which data is sent or transmitted from one location to another. If receiver and
                    sender are within a building, a wire may be the communication channel. If they are located at different
                    locations, the channel may be the telephone lines, fiber optics, satellite or microwaves.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    <i>Encoder and Decoder</i><br>
                    ▪ The computer works with digital signals. The communication channels usually use analog signals.
                    Therefore, to send data through a communication channel, the digital signals are encoded (or converted) into
                    analog signals or into a form which can be transmitted through transmission medium. This is called encoding.
                    The device that carries out this function is called <b>encoder.</b><br>
                    ▪ The computer works with digital signals. The communication channels usually use analog signals.
                    Therefore, to receive data from a communication channel, the coded analog signals or any other encoded
                    form are converted back to digital signals. This is called decoding. The device that carries out this function is
                    called <b>decoder.</b>

            <h2>Methods of Data Representation in Data Communication</h2>
            <p><br><br>
                <i>Decimal Numbers</i><br>
                ▪ As human we are used to writing numbers using digits 0 to 9. This is called base 10. This number
                system has been widely adopted, in large part because we have 10 fingers.
                However, other number systems still persist in modern society.
               <br><br><hr><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                   <i>Binary Numbers</i><br>
                   ▪ Any positive integer (whole number) can be represented by a sequence of 0s and 1s. Numbers in this
                   form are said to be in base 2, and are called binary numbers.
                   Computers are based on binary (base 2) number system because electrical wire can only be of two
                   states (on or off).
                </p>
                <br><br><hr><br>
                <p>
                   <i>Hexadecimal Numbers</i><br>
                   ▪ Writing numbers in binary is tedious since this representation uses between 3 to 4 times as many
                   digits as the decimal representation. The hexadecimal (base 16) number system is often used as shorthand
                   for binary. Base 16 is useful because 16 is a power of 2, and numbers have roughly as many digits as in the
                   corresponding decimal representation. Another name for hexadecimal numbers is alpha decimal because
                   the numbers are written from 0 to 9 and A to F. where A is 10, B is 11 up to F that is 15.
                </p>
                <br><br><hr><br>
                <p>
                   <i>Text</i><br>
                   ▪ American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII code) defines 128 different symbols. The
                   symbols are all the characters found on a standard keyboard, plus a few extra. Unique numeric code (0 to
                   127) is assigned to each character. In ASCII, “A” is 65, “B” is 66, “a” is 97, “b” is 98, and so forth. When a file
                   is save as “plain text”, it is stored using ASCII. ASCII format uses 1 byte per character 1 byte gives only 256
                   (128 standard and 128 non-standard) possible characters. The code value for any character can be converter
                   to base 2, so any written message made up of ASCII characters can be converted to a string of 0s and 1s.

                <p>
                    <i>Graphics</i><br>
                    ▪ Graphics on computer screen are consists of pixels. The pixels are tiny dots of color that collectively
                    paint a graphic image on a computer screen. It is physical point in a raster image, or the smallest
                    addressable element in an all points addressable display device. Hence it is the smallest controllable
                    element of a picture represented on the screen. The address of a pixel corresponds to its physical
                    coordinates. LCD pixels are manufactured in two-dimensional grid, and are often represented using dots or
                    squares, but CRT pixels correspond to their timing mechanism and sweep rates. The pixels are organized
                    into many rows and columns on the screen.
